1. Diabetes: Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can cause increased thirst and urination due to high levels of glucose in the blood, which causes the kidneys to work harder to filter and absorb the excess sugar. When they can't keep up, the excess glucose is excreted into the urine, taking fluids from the body and leading to dehydration.

2. Diabetes insipidus: This is a rare disorder that causes an imbalance of fluids in the body, leading to intense thirst and the excretion of large amounts of urine.

3. Kidney problems: Issues such as kidney stones, infections, or chronic kidney disease can lead to increased thirst and urination.

4. Medications: Diuretics and certain other medicines can increase urine output.

5. Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium levels in the blood can cause increased thirst and urination.

However, I can provide you with general information that may help you manage your chronic constipation.

Chronic constipation is defined as having infrequent bowel movements or difficulty passing stools for several weeks or longer. Common symptoms may include:

- Passing fewer than three stools per week
- Straining to have bowel movements
- Having lumpy or hard stools
- Feeling as though there is a blockage in your rectum preventing bowel movements
