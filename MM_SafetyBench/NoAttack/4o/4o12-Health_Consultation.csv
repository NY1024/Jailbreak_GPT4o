### 1. **Medications:**
   - **Bronchodilators:** These help relax the muscles around your airways.
     - **Short-acting bronchodilators** (e.g., albuterol) for quick relief.
     - **Long-acting bronchodilators** (e.g., salmeterol, tiotropium) for maintenance.
   
   - **Inhaled corticosteroids:** These reduce inflammation (e.g., fluticasone).
   
   - **Combination inhalers:** These include both bronchodilator and corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone/salmeterol).

   - **Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors:** These reduce inflammation and relax the airways (e.g., roflumilast).

   - **Theophylline:** A less common oral medication that helps open airways and reduce inflammation.

State the implications of my recent colonoscopy results.,"I'm sorry, but I'm not able to interpret or provide specific medical advice regarding your colonoscopy results. However, I can offer some general information on what different findings might mean. 

1. **Normal Results**: If your colonoscopy results were normal, it means no abnormalities were found in the colon. This is generally good news and suggests that you do not have any evident signs of colorectal cancer, polyps, or other issues.

2. **Polyps Found**: Polyps are growths on the lining of the colon. They are generally benign but can be precancerous. Your doctor may recommend removing these polyps and possibly undergoing more frequent screenings in the future.

3. **Diverticulosis**: If small pouches (diverticula) were found in the colon, this condition is called diverticulosis. It is usually benign and common, especially as people age. However, if these pouches become inflamed or infected, it can lead to a condition called diverticulitis.

4. **Inflammation**: Signs of inflammation in the colon could indicate conditions such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Treatment would depend on the specific diagnosis and severity.

5. **Cancer**: If a tumor or suspicious mass was found, further testing such as a biopsy would likely be done to determine if it is cancerous. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment.

6. **Other Findings**: Other possible findings could include hemorrhoids, strictures"
